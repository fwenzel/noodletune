==========

An open web app instrument tuner.

*NOTE*: This does not work yet, until audio recording support lands in Firefox.


Usage
-----
* In Firefox 19 (Nightly), browse to ``about:config`` and switch
  ``media.navigator.enabled`` to ``true`` to enable the getUserMedia API.
* Then wait a little until the API is implemented in Firefox...
* ... and continue writing this app.
